### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Ken. I have a Master of Science in Information Management degree specializing in Data Science from the University of Washington's Information School. I love using data to learn more about the "story" that it tells and help guide future decision-making. I work in Python and R, and am happy to share some of my favorite projects here on GitHub. You can find the code for these projects at my [GitHub Repositories Page](https://github.com/kj-masumo?tab=repositories).

### Recipe Ingredient Substitution Finder
